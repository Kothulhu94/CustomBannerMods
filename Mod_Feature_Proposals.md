# Potential Upgrades and Feature Proposals


## 2. Brigands
*   **Hideout Expansion:** Allow the Syndicate to take over Hideouts, fortifying them into mini-castles that send out stronger parties.
*   **Bribe System:** If a Syndicate party catches the player, allow a "Bribe" option to pay them off based on the Player's Roguery skill.

## 3. CoastalLife
*   **Naval Trade Routes:** Allow purchasing a "Trade Ship" that automatically moves between two coastal towns, generating passive gold but risking Corsair attacks.
*   **Deep Sea Fishing:** Upgrade for villages/towns. Adds a "Fishing Fleet" (Cost: 20k) that dramatically increases food production but lowers security (pirates).
*   **Smuggling:** Add a "Smuggler's Cove" building to the Docking Slip management. Generates Roguery XP and high gold, but lowers relation with honest merchants.

## 4. HappyParty
*   **Morale Events:** Random events when camping (e.g., "The Bard Sings") that boost morale for a gold cost.
*   **Companion Training:** Allow "Instructor" companions (from HonestWork concept) to passively give XP to other companions in the party, not just troops.
*   **Feasts:** Re-implement Warband-style feasts in towns. If an AI Lord buys enough "Gourmet" food, they hold a feast, boosting relations with all lords in the settlement.

## 5. HonestWork
*   **Guild System:** If player works enough hours as "Artisan", unlock "Guild Master" status, allowing passive income from that job type in all towns.
*   **Mercenary Contracts:** "Guard" job can evolve into a specialized Mercenary Contract for a specific merchant, requiring you to escort their caravan to a destination.
*   **Criminal Enterprise:** "Thug" job leads to "Gang Leader". Allows taking over an alley in town (Vanilla mechanic expanded) to generate passive income and free "Thug" recruits.

## 6. Landlord
*   **Soil Quality dynamic:** Implement the `GetEfficiency` logic. River-side villages get +20% yield. Mountain villages get -10% yield but +20% defense.
*   **Estate House:** Visual upgrade. If the player is in the village scene, spawn a small house property that grows as they upgrade the Guardhouse.

## 7. LivingLegend
*   **Standard Bearer:** A new party role. High Renown allows assigning a "Standard Bearer" troop that boosts morale in battle radius.
*   **Legendary equipment:** At 10,000 Renown, prompt a quest to forge a "Legendary" weapon (Stats ++).
*   **Cult of Personality:** Settlements of the player's culture get a passive Loyalty buff simply for being owned by the Legend (Expand existing model).

## 8. NewClans
*   **King Promotion:** Fix the bug preventing Kings from promoting.
*   **Dynasty System:** Allow promoting Family Members (Children) to side-clans, creating a true Dynasty alliance block.
