To thank you for your help, he hands you a small bronze artifact which he says was once given to him in payment by a warrior who said only that it was related to 'Neretzes' Folly.' He suspects it might be of great value. You resolve to find out more. The doctor gives you one more bit of information. He overheard the bandits talking about captives they had seized on their raids. They planned to part ways, with one group taking their prisoners to the south, and the other planning to head northwest to sell them to pirates at the port of Ostican.
