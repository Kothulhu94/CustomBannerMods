Even though the land was at first considered marginal, it now produces a fine crop of wheat." />
    <string id="4L56zPos" text="The clifftop village of Skarthness is known for its intrepid hunters. While most of their neighbors are content to fish nearby banks, Skarthnessers voyage seasonally to the far north of Beinland on walrus hunts, bringing back valuable ivory." />

Villagers tell stories of their famously foul-tempered and miserly ancestor Kjar, who came inland from the sea to escape a blood feud.

    <string id="dwkbyCqk" text="Grud was a thegn of the jarl of Hargard who established an outpost on the Jumne river, which takes its name from the mysterious burial pits from some bygone people that lined its banks. The village named after him now raises sheep in pastures beside the river." />

Founded by Darshi-speaking merchants, it made its wealth buying horses, sheep and cattle from the surrounding herding villages and sending them west to the markets of the empire in huge drives, accompanied by guards to ward off raiders from the steppes.

    <string id="jRaphKwi" text="Sirindac lies beneath the high ridges of the Ebor peninsula, somewhat sheltered from the bitter winds blowing out of the northwest.

    <string id="Q3lvcUub" text="Vorfjall lies on the hills east of the Jumne, known for the bloom of purple lupin that fill the highland meadows in the late spring. The region also produces an abundant crop of wheat and is one of the breadbaskets of the eastern Nordvyg." />
    <string id="Q8OUGbzw" text="Elvania sits on the Bay of Ortysia, part of the seaway between the western ocean and the Perassic Sea. Hot southern afternoons and sea-cooled mornings make this good country for wine grapes." />
    <string id="rKW7FqWa" text="Midskag is named after the cape that lies roughly in the middle of the coastal Nordvyg route through the Byalic. The villagers of the region near Midskag make their living from the sea, harvesting cod and ice-char from nearby banks." />
    <string id="rtb00TvP" text="The village of Nogrent is one of a series of settlements on the Biscan coast known for its seafaring population.

    <string id="TKeLjx14" text="Haugr sits on the west branch of the Jumne river, where it meanders over its floodplain. It was named after a stone cairn on a riverside bluff, said by locals to have been built by forest-trolls. The region produces fine, dark clays, much prized by local potters." />

    <string id="TxIaLF54" text="Gauksdal sits on the middle reaches of the Jumne, the river that the Khuzaits call the Karakaz. This stretch of valley is named in commemoration of Gauk, a local homesteader, who escaped a Khuzait ambush by swimming across the river in spring when it was choked with floating ice. In the warmer months, villagers lay traps in the weedy shallows to catch pike and perch." />
    <string id="UCrwAaba" text="Galend overlooks the wave-beaten Biscan coast. It takes in the catch from the Biscan's intrepid fishermen and whalers who venture out far into the western ocean, as well as the wool of sheep from the green fog-covered hills.

    <string id="VbQhrOU9" text="Karahalli lies in the far north of the Khuzait confederacy, in borderlands contested by Sturgians and Nords. Though the winters are cold, the spring grasses are fine grazing for the local sheep, whose thick wool protects them from the region's piercing winds." />

    <string id="xNrbYYva" text="Faergap lies beside the Jumne river as it cuts through the hills known as the Iltanhindrun, named because they posed a barrier to mountain tribes just across the frontiers.

The region is rich in wheat, barley and other grains." />
    <string id="Xom9DeXZ" text="Balgard, which sits on the icy waters of the Byalic Sea, was founded by migrants from the Nordvyg. Legend holds that the initial wave of Nords arrogantly demanded tribute from the nearby Vakken and Sturgian tribes, who formed an alliance and drove the newcomers back to their ships. But the victors fell out over the spoils, until a canny Nord, Gundar, landed and volunteered to help them fairly divvy up the weapons and armor of his dead kinsmen. The residents recognized Gundar's lordship over the region and his descendants, intermarried with the Sturgians, are today the grand princes of Sturgia." />

    <string id="zh2tG1MX" text="Nordic tribes pushing into the dark forests to their east founded the citadel of Hargard several generations ago. It overlooks the river that the Nords call the Jumne, probably a derivation of a Sturgian term for the mysterious burial pits found along its banks. Today, the river forms the main artery of transportation for the Nord kingdom's eastern domains, a meeting-place of Nords, Vanni, Sturgians, and even some forest-dwelling cousins of the steppe tribes, all harvesting the wealth of the river-valley to sell to the peoples of the south." />
    <string id="Zn9NwSTf" text="Hvalvik is the main port on the remote northern island known to the Nords as Beinland, the land of bones. It is debated whether the island's namesake comes from the walrus ivory that drew hunters here, or the only trace that many left behind, buried in shallow graves alongside its bleak gravel-covered shores. In the last few generations, however, a run of milder winters and a growing mainland population has encouraged colonists to seek their fortune in Beinland, and the former cluster of whalers' huts known as Hvalvik is now a thriving town." />
    <string id="znRLc4v1" text="Montos sits at the base of the Cursion escarpment, near the Battanian frontier. The farmers here keep a watchful eye when tending their hillside fields, always looking for raiding parties coming westward from the valley of the Miron river to their east." />
